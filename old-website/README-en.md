## Principle

Many poly-disabled people are not able to use their limbs (hands, feet) or their voices in a precise way. Tools and games on digital terminals are thus inaccessible to them. In many cases, gaze is the most direct way that enable them to interact.

Obviously the games must remain simple and the interactions pretty direct to help individuals to understand and assimilate the consequences of their action, or we can say the consequences of their gaze in this case. We can imagine games consisting of shooting targets, bricks, card games, memory etc.

These games should offer at least two advantages to the individual:
1) Allowing him to train his gaze in order to offer him the possibility of acquiring more complex interactions.

2) To entertain him.

## Default directory of GazePlay

For all operating systems, software default directory is called *GazePlay* and is in the user directory. For instance, if the user name is *NomUtilisateur*, the path to the directory will be:

* On **Windows** C:\Users\NomUtilisateur\Documents

* On **MacOs** /Users/NomUtilisateur/GazePlay

* On **Linux** /home/NomUtilisateur/GazePlay

## Change images

In a directory called *XXX* (the name you wish), another directory where you will put a directory called *images*.
 
*images* can have 3 other directories :

1) *portraits* : images used by *creampie*, *ninja* and *bubles portrait*. Images should be small (300x300 pixels).

2) *magiccards* : images used by *magic cards*. You can use all image sizes.

3) *blocs* : images used by *blocs* and *Scratchcard*. Choose big images (the best is at least screen size).

Vous can have as much directory *XXX* as you wish and change the selected one thanks to the configuration interface.
